Problem for which will have a straight forward solution -----> algorithmic problems 

eg- addition of two number
move to resturant 
move to a temple 

Problem for which will not have a straight forward solution -----> heuristic problems 

eg - predicting best stocks 
give me 300cr 


** you need to have a knowledege of six steps in order to solve any problems (algorithimic as well as heuristic) **

1. identify the problem 
2. understand the problem 
3. find the alternate ways to solve this problems
4. find the best way to solve the problem.
5. write the steps to execute the best solution.
6. evaluation to the best solution.






first number is 7
second number  is 6 
sum of first and secomd number stored im sum 

sum is equivalent to sum of first and second number that is 13 


calculate the cost of using bike for one month 
steps 

1. yes i have a bike 
2. i ride my bike daily 
3. At minimum i spend my time with my bike around 1 to 2hrs.
4. my bike average is almost 60km/liter
5 i cover the distance around 15 km daily basis.
6 according to distance coverage by 15km daily, basis of my 
average of my bike i spend 25.5 rs daily 
7. and also i keep my bike clean and maintain their average by their servicing in a week, there i spend 150rs in a week 
8. the over all cost i spend on the bike for a month is 
25.5*30 + 150*4 = 1365rs/month

VARIABLE, CONSTANT, DATA TYPE 
1. VARIABLE - it is nothing but it is something that can change .
eg - pm of country 
cm of state
2. constant - it cannot change.
eg- father name 
your number of sibling 

x -
