Problem for which will have a straight forward solution -----> algorithmic problems 

eg- addition of two number
move to resturant 
move to a temple 

Problem for which will not have a straight forward solution -----> heuristic problems 

eg - predicting best stocks 
give me 300cr 


** you need to have a knowledege of six steps in order to solve any problems
 (algorithimic as well as heuristic) **

1. identify the problem 
2. understand the problem 
3. find the alternate ways to solve this problems
4. find the best way to solve the problem.
5. write the steps to execute the best solution.
6. evaluation to the best solution.




** Add two numbers **

first number is 7
second number  is 6 
sum of first and secomd number stored im sum 

sum is equivalent to sum of first and second number that is 13 


**calculate the cost of using bike for one month 
steps **
--by me --
1. yes i have a bike 
2. i ride my bike daily 
3. At minimum i spend my time with my bike around 1 to 2hrs.
4. my bike average is almost 60km/liter
5 i cover the distance around 15 km daily basis.
6 according to distance coverage by 15km daily, basis of my 
average of my bike i spend 25.5 rs daily 
7. and also i keep my bike clean and maintain their average by their servicing in a week, there i spend 150rs in a week 
8. the over all cost i spend on the bike for a month is 
25.5*30 + 150*4 = 1365rs/month

-- BY SIR --
a. on average how hours i spend with my bike a day (x min)
b. on average how many kms i cover my bike in a day (y km)
   b.1- in 1 km, how much petrol do we consume - (l liter)
   b.2- cost of 1 liter of petrol - (p liter)

c. in the current month how many days we have (30 days)
d. in the current month how many holidays do we have (z days)
e. know how to perform addition, substtraction, multiplication
f. calculate number of active days (30-z)
g. calculate time cost (30-z)*X mins
h. calculate distance covered (30-z)*Y km
i. calculate finacial cost (30-z)*Y*l*P

** VARIABLE, CONSTANT, DATA TYPE **

1. VARIABLE -  it is something that we can change their value .
eg - pm of country 
     cm of state
2. constant - it is something that we cannot change theit value.
eg- your father name 
    your number of sibling 
    number of pm, cm in our country
    indian currency notes

** calculate the average of 5 numbers **

Sudhanshu: 780, 450, 1289, 765, 653

steps:
1. Identify the problem ----> calculate average of 5 numbers

2. understand the problem -----> 
   2.a - we have five numbers
   2.b - how many container do we need to hold these numbers (5)
   2.b - hold yours numbers 
           x1 - 780
           x2 - 450
           x3 - 1289
           x4 - 765
           x5 - 653

step -3 and step - 4 is not that much meaningful here

5. (x1+x2+x3+x4+x5)/5

6. 0.1 ms it take to perform this addition and consume 10mb of memory 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. DATA TYPE: 

1,2,3,-7,-8,-1 -------> integer 

1.88,3.43,1.3,-4.5,-1.6 -----------> floating point value

'a','b', '1', '&','.'----------> character

True/ False -----------> boolean 

"avinashpatro"---------------> string

**** AND , OR , not ***** ------> (they both are need two operand )

AND ---> AND is produce true if both left and right is true.
OR ---------> OR is produce true if either left or right is true.

AND ----> AND is produce false if either left or right is false 
OR ------> OR is produce false if both left and right is false.

example- 

true AND true ----> true 
false AND true ----> false
true AND false ----> false 
false AND false ----> false 

true OR true ----> true
false OR true ----> true
true OR false ----> true
false OR false ----> false

not True --------> false 
not False ---------> true 


question: 

 a = true 
 b = false 
 c = true 
 d = false 

 R = (a AND b) or (b or a)
 R = false or true 
 R = true 

R1 = c or (a AND b) AND (a or b ) or (a or c)
R1 = true or false AND true or true
R1 = true AND true 
R1 = true 

R2 = not (a AND b AND  c) AND not (c or d) AND a 
R2 = not false AND not true AND true
R2 = true AND false AND true 
R2 = false
