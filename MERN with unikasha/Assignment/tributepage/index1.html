    <h4>here's a time line of Dr.Norman Borlaug</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Norman Ernest Borlaug The Nobel Peace Prize 1970</li>
      <li>Residence at the time of the award: USA</li>
      <li>
        Role: International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, Mexico City
      </li>
      <li>
        Prize motivation: “for having given a well-founded hope - the green
        revolution”
      </li>
      <li>
        The expression “the green revolution” is permanently linked to Norman
        Borlaug's name.
      </li>
      <li>
        He obtained a PhD in plant protection at the age of 27, and worked in
        Mexico in the 1940s and 1950s to make the country self-sufficient in
        grain. Borlaug recommended improved methods of cultivation, and
        developed a robust strain of wheat - dwarf wheat - that was adapted to
        Mexican conditions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Success in Mexico made Borlaug a much sought-after adviser to countries
        whose food production was not keeping pace with their population growth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Borlaug is a warm adherent of birth control. The object was to strike a
        balance between population growth and food production.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fourteen laureates were awarded a Nobel Prize in 2022, for achievements
        that have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.
      </li>
      <li>
        Their work and discoveries range from paleogenomics and click chemistry
        to documenting war crimes.
      </li>
      <li>
        The expression “the green revolution” made Borlaug's name known beyond
        scientific circles, but he always emphasized that he himself was only
        part of a team.
      </li>
    </ul>
