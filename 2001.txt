pseudocode:
----> just some rough steps to perform a job/task 
-----> machines can not understand pseudocode
------> pseudocode is for humans to organise their solution

question: 
write a pseudocode to add two numbers:

BEGIN EXECUTION
  READ number1
  READ number2 
  result = ADD number1,number2
  WRITE result 
END EXECUTION

QUESTION : 
write a pseudocode to substract , multply and divide two number

BEGIN EXECUTION OF CODE 
  READ number1 
  READ number2 
  substraction = number1 - number2 
  multiplication = number1 * number2
  divide = number1 / number2
END EXECUTION OF CODE 

IF and ELSE 

1st way- 

BEGIN
  READ number 
  IF number is even:
    WRITE "number is even"
   ELSE
     WRITE "number is odd"
   END IF and ELSE statement 
END 

2st way- 

BEGIN
  READ number 
  IF number MOD 2 = 0:
    WRITE "number is even"
   ELSE
     WRITE "number is odd"
   END IF and ELSE statement 
END

** concept of MOD ***
number MOD 2 = 0 --------> number is even
number MOD 2 = 1 --------> number is odd

QUESTION:
write a pseudocode to check if a number is less than or equals to 10

BEGIN
  READ number 
  IF number <= 10:
    WRITE "number is less than equal to 10"
   ELSE
     WRITE "number is not less than equal to 10"
   END IF and ELSE statement 
END

QUESTION : 
write a pseudocode to calculate average of 3 numbers

BEGIN
  READ number1, number2, number3 
  
SET sum = number1+ number2+ number3 

SET average = sum/3

WRITE average
END

QUESTION : 
write a pseudocode to find greater of three number

BEGIN

  READ num1, num2, num3 
  
IF num1>num2 AND num1>num3    // (we cannot use OR here bcz if either one of them becomes true its consider as a true. )
  WRITE num1
ELSE 
  IF num2>num1 AND num2>num3
    WRITE num2
  ELSE 
    WRITE num3

END 

QUESTION:
write a pseudocode to check if a number is divisible by 18 as well as 3 

BEGIN

  READ number

IF number MOD 3=0
  IF number MOD 18=0
    WRITE "it is divisible by 18 and 3 both "
  ELSE 
    WRITE "it is divisible by 3 but not by 18"
ELSE 
  IF number MOD 18=0
    WRITE "it is divisible by 18 but not by 3"
  ELSE 
    WRITE "it is not divisible by 18 and by 3 both"

END

LOOP

1. FOR-LOOP

QUESTION:
write a pseudocode to print "hello sir" 6 times

approach1:

BEGIN
  WRITE "hello sir"
  WRITE "hello sir"
  WRITE "hello sir"
  WRITE "hello sir"
  WRITE "hello sir"
  WRITE "hello sir"
END

approach2:

BEGIN
   SET num 1 / CREATE num 
   FOR num = 1 to 6:                 // FOR LOOP 
      WRITE "hello sir"
END

QUESTION:
write a pseudocode to print from 1 to 100

BEGIN
   CREATE num
   FOR num = 1 to 100:                
      WRITE num
END

QUESTION:
write all the odd numbers in the range 1 to 50,000

BEGIN
   CREATE num
   FOR num 1 to 50,000:  
      IF num MOD 2=1            
        WRITE num
END

QUESTION: 
write a pseudocode to print number from 1 to 10000 with 5 steps

output: 1,6,11,16,21,26..........

BEGIN
   CREATE num
   FOR num 1  to 10000:   
       WRITE num
     SET num num+5
END
